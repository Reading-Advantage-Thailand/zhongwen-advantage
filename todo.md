# Tutor Advantage Development Todo

## Documentation Usage and Maintenance

IMPORTANT: Before starting any task:

1. Read all relevant files in `/docs/standards/` to ensure compliance with project standards
2. Read any files in `/docs/core-libraries/` that pertain to your current task
3. Update documentation whenever:
   - You encounter an issue related to project standards
   - You discover new patterns or best practices
   - You find errors or outdated information
   - You implement new features that require documentation
4. Update the task completion status as tasks are completed.

This documentation-first approach ensures consistency, reduces errors, and maintains high code quality across the project.
