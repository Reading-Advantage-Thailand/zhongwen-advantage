# Current Task: User Account Components Implementation

## Objectives

Import and adapt user account management components from ra-source:

- [ ] Import user-account-nav.tsx
  - [ ] Copy from ra-source/web/components/user/user-account-nav.tsx
  - [ ] Update imports to match our structure
  - [ ] Integrate with our authentication system
  - [ ] Add i18n support for menu items
  
- [ ] Import user-avatar.tsx
  - [ ] Copy from ra-source/web/components/user/user-avatar.tsx
  - [ ] Update image handling for Chinese names
  - [ ] Add proper alt text translations
  - [ ] Test with various Chinese character lengths

- [ ] Import change-username-form.tsx
  - [ ] Copy from ra-source/web/components/user/change-username-form.tsx
  - [ ] Add validation for Chinese characters
  - [ ] Implement i18n for form labels and messages
  - [ ] Test with mixed language input

## Implementation Steps

1. For each component:
   - Create test file first (TDD approach)
   - Copy component from ra-source
   - Update imports and dependencies
   - Add i18n integration
   - Test with Chinese character support
   - Document any Chinese-specific adaptations

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test components together
   - Verify i18n works across all states
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Validate Chinese character display

3. Documentation:
   - Update component usage examples
   - Document any Chinese-specific features
   - Add i18n key requirements

## Technical Considerations

- Using next-international for i18n
- Proper handling of Chinese character display
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Type-safe translations
- Integration with existing auth system

## Implementation Status

### Completed

1. Locale Configuration

   - Imported locale-config.ts with support for:
     - English (en)
     - Thai (th)
     - Simplified Chinese (cn)
     - Traditional Chinese (tw)
     - Vietnamese (vi)
   - Set up locale names and feedback language mappings
   - Configured dynamic imports for translation files

2. Middleware Implementation

   - Set up next-international middleware
   - Configured locale detection and routing
   - Integrated with authentication system
   - Added role-based redirects
   - Configured public page handling

3. Translation Files

   - Copied all locale files from ra-source:
     - en.ts (English)
     - th.ts (Thai)
     - cn.ts (Simplified Chinese)
     - tw.ts (Traditional Chinese)
     - vi.ts (Vietnamese)
   - Maintained complete translation structure for future component imports

4. Supporting Files

   - Created necessary enum files for role-based routing
   - Set up directory structure for i18n system

5. Main Page Internationalization
   - Moved page.tsx to [locale]/page.tsx
   - Implemented translations for:
     - Hero section
     - Features section
     - Technical highlights
     - Call to action
   - Set up hardcoded feature lists for initial implementation
   - Integrated with server-side translation functions

### Verified Functionality

1. Configuration:

   - Locale definitions
   - Default language setting
   - Import paths

2. Middleware:

   - Locale routing setup
   - Authentication integration
   - Role-based redirects

3. Translations:
   - File structure
   - Language support
   - Import configuration
   - Server-side rendering with translations

## Technical Considerations

- Using next-international for i18n
- Middleware-based locale detection
- Type-safe translations
- Integration with Next.js App Router
- Role-based routing support
- Server-side rendering of translated content

   - Navigation components
   - User profile components
2. Test language switching functionality
3. Implement language preference persistence
