# Current Task: Importing User Components

## Progress Made

1. Created Firebase Admin initialization (src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts)
2. Created Firebase client configuration (src/lib/firebase.ts)
3. Set up NextAuth configuration (src/lib/auth.ts)
4. Created NextAuth API route (src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts)
5. Added NextAuth session provider (src/providers/nextauth-session-provider.tsx)
6. Added utility functions (src/lib/utils.ts)

## Current Issues

1. The main blocker is a dependency issue with @opentelemetry/api which is required by @google-cloud/firestore
2. This is causing the NextAuth API routes to fail with a 500 error
3. The error occurs when trying to initialize Firebase Admin and access Firestore
