# Current Task: Reading Advantage Import Planning

## Current Objective

Create a systematic plan for importing and adapting Reading Advantage's codebase for Chinese language learning.

## Recent Progress

### Landing Page Implementation

- Completed main page adaptation using existing navigation components
- Added shadcn Button component for consistent UI
- Implemented responsive layout with proper Chinese learning context
- Set up essential styling configurations:
  - Updated globals.css with shadcn variables
  - Configured Tailwind for component styling
  - Fixed TypeScript path aliases

## Available Source Components

### Components to Import

From Reading Advantage's custom-components.md:

- Complete article component system
- Audio/Visual component suite
- ✓ Navigation components
- User management components
- Dashboard components
- Exercise system
- Question components
- Teacher components
- System components

### Functions to Import

From Reading Advantage's custom-functions.md:

- Data fetching utilities
- Authentication system
- Level calculation
- Classroom management
- File operations
- Educational assessment

### Structure to Import

From Reading Advantage's mvp-structure.md and page-structure.md:

- Complete MVP architecture
- Route group organization
- API endpoint structure

## Import Process Setup

### 1. Repository Setup

- [ ] Clone Reading Advantage repository locally
- [ ] Create separate git branches for different import categories:
  - branch: direct-imports (for components requiring no modification)
  - branch: adapted-imports (for components needing Chinese support)
  - branch: new-features (for Chinese-specific features)

### 2. Project Structure Setup

- [x] Create matching directory structure:
  ```
  /
  ├── app/                    # Next.js 14 App Router
  ├── components/            # React Components
  ├── api/                  # API Routes
  └── lib/                 # Utilities
  ```
- [x] Set up essential configuration files
- [x] Initialize base dependencies from Reading Advantage's package.json

### 3. Import Workflow

1. For each component/function:

   - Review source code from Reading Advantage
   - Assess Chinese language requirements
   - Copy to appropriate directory
   - Test functionality
   - Document changes

2. Testing Process:

   - Unit test imported component
   - Integration test with Chinese features
   - Performance test for Chinese text handling

3. Documentation:
   - Update projectRoadmap.md with progress
   - Document modifications in codebaseSummary.md
   - Note technical decisions in techStack.md

## Technical Considerations

### Character Support Requirements

- Unicode handling for Chinese characters
- Font rendering considerations
- Character input methods
- Stroke order animations

### Text Processing Needs

- Chinese text segmentation
- Pinyin generation
- Traditional/Simplified conversion
- Character decomposition

### Audio Requirements

- Text-to-speech for Chinese
- Tone pronunciation
- Audio recording and playback

## Current Focus

Continue systematic import of Reading Advantage components while adapting for Chinese language support. Next components to focus on are user management and dashboard components.

## Next Steps

1. Test the implemented landing page thoroughly
2. Begin importing user management components
3. Set up authentication system
4. Continue documenting progress in projectRoadmap.md
